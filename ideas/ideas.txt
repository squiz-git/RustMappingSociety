/ A place for map ideas: 

A general haunted theme maybe, or a newly discovered planet which has strange non human built structures? let me know what you think
Might need a story to stick to, so we can change prefabs/monuments to suite it better

Some monument ideas:

An overseer type thing who watches the over the map from a bunker or something, tons of cameras in map tie into this bunker
-bunker will require two swipes of redcard, entrance must be hidden and/or difficult to get into
-bunker must have scientists and other security and possibly traps

Pretty much customise every prefab/monument to the theme/story behind the map
-Could have a central spawn point depending on what theme we go for
